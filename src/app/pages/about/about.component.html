      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Harry, a full-stack developer based in the UK. I love building clean, performant web apps that solve real
        problems and create value for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing two years of Computer Science at the University of Kent, I continued developing my skills through the
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full-Stack Engineer Career Path</a> at Codecademy.
        This journey recently led me to complete a full-stack social media app using React, Express, and PostgreSQL.
